# PiG_Bot
A Human-Like StarCraft II Training Opponent

Built using [python-sc2](https://burnysc2.github.io/python-sc2/index.html) and the [ARES framework](https://aressc2.github.io/ares-sc2/api_reference/index.html).

## Project Overview

**What Inspired This Project?**  
The default StarCraft II in-game AI makes a terrible training partner. This project aims to provide a more challenging, human-like opponent for competitive players.

**Is This For You?**  
- StarCraft II players seeking a challenging AI at different skill levels.

**Why You'll Love This Bot**  
- The bot plays in a way that mimics human opponents.
- Difficulty is adjustable.
- The bot adapts to its opponentâ€™s strategies.

**How You Can Use This Bot**  
- Play against the bot in custom games.
- Use it as a training partner to improve your skills.

**Key Features**  
- Builds according to the Bronze to GM macro standard.
- Scouts and gathers enemy information.
- Reacts to common cheese (Zergling Rush, Cannon Rush, Probe Rush).
- Uses disruptors and basic micro (a-move, stutter step).
- Responds to threats with appropriate unit counters.
- Maintains 3 bases and 66 probes.
- Switches builds based on scouting (pre-defined build switches).
- Fights only when favored.
- Runs 2 build orders per matchup:
    - **PvP:** 4 Gate All-in, 2 Gate Expand
    - **PvZ:** Standard Robo Opener, Double Stargate Phoenix (vs Mutas)
    - **PvT:** Standard Macro Build, Proxy Rax Response

**Tracked Data**  
- Opponent race, map name, game result, build order used, build loss flag, time build switched, enemy openings and units seen, air tech detection, fight outcomes, units lost, expansions taken, and more (see code for full list).
